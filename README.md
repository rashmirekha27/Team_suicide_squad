# Team_suicide_squad

ITEMS IN PROJECT

The Project Proposal is the initial proposal approved at the outset of the project
The Tehcnical Report file contains the summary of extraction, transformation, and loading steps taken to complete the project
The Team_suicide.ipnyb file contains the python code (in Jupyter Notebook) for extracting and transforming the data, and the load into PostgresSQL
*** Note: The password used in the Jupyter Notebook to load the data to Postgres is NOT "admin". It is a different password. A user would need to edit the Jupyter Notebook with their password for this code to run as-is. 
The team_suicide.sql contains the SQL code for creating the Postgres tables from our Jupyter Notebook code
The Reosurces folder contains the initial .csv files from kaggle that were used in the project
