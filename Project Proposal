Theme: Do World Happiness Scores have an inverse relationship with Suicide Rates?

Both sources report data by country and year, and 2015 and 2016 are the overlapping years in both. Country is a column found in both datasets. 
Aside from the overall Happiness Score, the World Happiness Scores dataset also contains an impact score for several factors: Economy, Family, Health, Freedom, and Trust in Government. The suicide rate per country may have a more significant relationship with one of these factors than it does with the overall score. 

Sources (both from kaggle):
World Happiness Report - use .csv files for 2015 and 2016
Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 - filter dataset to years 2015 and 2016

Database to be used: PostgresQL
